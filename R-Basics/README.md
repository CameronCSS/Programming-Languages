## R Programming Language Basics

R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Python has gained popularity over the years, but R is still widely used today.
In fact, R is still one of the most popular programming languages for data analysis and machine learning.

<br>

### Why should I use R* ?

---

- FREE and open-source:
<ul>R is a free and open-source language, which means that it can be used by anyone without any licensing fees. This makes it an accessible option for individuals and organizations of all sizes.</ul>

<br>

- Rich ecosystem: 
<ul>R has a very large and active community of developers who contribute to a wide range of packages and tools for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. This means that there are many powerful tools available to R users that are specifically designed for their needs.</ul>

<br>

- Easy to learn:
<ul>R has a relatively easy-to-learn syntax and is designed to be user-friendly for statisticians and data analysts, even those who do not have a strong programming background.</ul>

<br>

- Flexibility:
<ul>R is a highly flexible language that can be used for a wide range of data analysis and modeling tasks, from simple data manipulation to complex machine learning algorithms.</ul>

<br>

- Reproducibility:
<ul>R provides a powerful set of tools for reproducible research, including the ability to create automated reports and share code and data with others.</ul>

### The basics of R:
##### *NOTE: This isnt a full collection of everything R can do. Just a summary of the basics*

:small_blue_diamond:R is easy to learn!

:small_blue_diamond:R is generally considered to be an easy language to learn and use, 
especially for those who have some background in programming or statistics. 

:small_blue_diamond:Here is some sample R code that demonstrates some basic functionality:


### CODE

```r
# Create a vector of numbers from 1 to 5
my_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Calculate the mean of the vector
mean(my_vector)

# Create a matrix of random numbers
my_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(25), nrow=5, ncol=5)

# Subset the matrix to include only the first two rows and columns
my_subset <- my_matrix[1:2, 1:2]

# Plot the subset as a heatmap
heatmap(my_subset)


```

## Sample Data Project

:bookmark_tabs: __Here's a sample data project example using the 'mtcars' dataset that comes with R that demonstrates some common data analysis and visualization tasks:__
<br>
```r
# Load the required packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data into R (use mtcars dataset as an example)
data <- mtcars

# Examine the structure of the data
str(data)

# View the first few rows of the data
head(data)

# Calculate summary statistics for a numeric variable
summary(data$mpg)

# Create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between two variables
ggplot(data, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()

# Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of a variable
ggplot(data, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Filter the data to include only rows that meet a certain condition
filtered_data <- filter(data, cyl == 6)

# Group the data by a categorical variable and calculate summary statistics for each group
grouped_data <- group_by(data, cyl) %>%
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))

# Create a bar chart to visualize the summary statistics for each group
ggplot(grouped_data, aes(x = cyl, y = mean_mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")


```

This code loads the required libraries, dplyr and ggplot2. Then, it loads the mtcars dataset and examines the structure of the data and the first few rows. It calculates summary statistics for a numeric variable, mpg, and creates a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between weight (wt) and mpg. It also creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of mpg. The code then filters the data to include only rows where the number of cylinders (cyl) is equal to 6. Next, it groups the data by the number of cylinders and calculates the mean mpg for each group. Finally, it creates a bar chart to visualize the summary statistics for each group.
