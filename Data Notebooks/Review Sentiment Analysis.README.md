## Review Sentiment Analysis using Selenium and Python

Using Selenium and python I scraped products and their reviews from two websites.
The review wording is ran through a NLP to decipher the sentiment behind the review.

The overall review scores from each website was then compared to the sentiment score to compare how accurate the reviews scores really were.

I found one website seemed to be artificially boosting their reviews scores since I could not find a review under a 4 out of 5.
It appears their 4.1-5.0 scale was realistically a 1-10 scale skewed to look more positive overall.

I verified the results by manually comparing context text from several reviews vs teh actual wording from the review.
