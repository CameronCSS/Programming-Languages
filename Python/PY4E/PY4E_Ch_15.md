## SQL (Structured Query Language)

- Structured Query Language is the language we use to issue commands to the database
* Create a table
* Retrieve some data
* Insert data
* Delete data


### Terms

- Database - contains many tables

- Relation (or table) - contains tuples and attributes

- Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track

- Attribute (also column or field) - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row


# Using Databases

### There are Two Roles in Large Projects

- Application Developer - Builds the logic for the application, the look and feel of the application - monitors the application for problems

- Database Administrator - Monitors and adjusts the database as the program runs in production

- Often both people participate in the build of the "Data Model"

## CRUD

CREATE> READ> UPDATE> DELETE
